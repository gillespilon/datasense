- Supervised machine learning
- Six Sigma methodology
- Regular expressions
- Process capability
- Process variation
- Excel file edits
- Taguchi Methods
- Data Science
- Automation
- Analytics

Why **datasense**?

- Equivalent Python functions that are available in R, SAS, JMP, Minitab
- Other packages have limited process control analysis features
- Other packages are abandoned or inadequately supported
- Functions to support measurement system analysis
- Functions to simplify statistics, graphs, etc.
- Functions to support process control charts
- Functions to support SQL functionality
