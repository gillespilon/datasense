datasense

Statistical and graphical functions for:

- Data science
- Analysing process variation
- Six Sigma methodology

Why this?

- Wanted functions to support process control charts.
- Wanted functions to support measurement system analysis.
- Develop a package that is open-source for those unable to buy software.
- Wanted Python functions that are available in R and SAS.
- Other packages have limited features for process control analysis.
- Other packages are abandoned or inadequately supported.
